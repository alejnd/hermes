            Hermes: rest message proxy
	    

    What is it?
    -----------
    
Hermes is a simple personal project to make a REST service to allow
to other applications send notifications via email, and get tracked 
in a database.

Originally supported gtalk using XMPP but google no longer supports
this protocol and now its a legacy feature. May be this feature can
be used for connect to standard XMPP services.  

    Usage
    -----

First of all, go to tweepy directory and install the python library,
fill hermes.cfg with your account information and lanuch it with
python server.py

Now you can send messages using python or commanline.

Test example:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"msg":"hi from curl","log_level":"DEBUG"}' http://localhost:5000/twitter/notify

You can also see: posttest.py. Its provides and example about how to
post a message using standard python libraries.
